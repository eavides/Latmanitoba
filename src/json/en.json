  "Mision": "To assist Latina women and other genders by providing them with guidance and support to achieve their aspirations for academic, social, and economic progress. This is accomplished through support programs including seminars, talks, and workshops, aimed at informing and educating in social, cultural, employment, and linguistic aspects. It allows them to express their concerns and resolve them through active community participation.",
  "Vision": "A united community where every Latina shines, reaching her full potential in a supportive, diverse, and resilient environment.",
  "Description": "Latinas Manitoba INC. is a non-profit organization incorporated in the year 2021. It originated as a social media group in early 2020, during the pandemic, aiming to empower and assist Latin and Spanish-speaking women in Manitoba. Its goal is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and provide support in the process of cultural and migratory adaptation. Inspired by the women who came before us in times not as easy as the 20th-century wave, those Latina women who did not have the means or opportunities that we have now and can share.",
